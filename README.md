SQL queries I wrote on the Hubway Bicycle database (https://www.kaggle.com/harunshimanto/hubway-bicycles-in-boston).

A) 'data_cleaning' is a script that cleaned one part of the 'gender' column in the 'trips' table. 

B) 'returned_or_not' orders the bike stations by the rate at which users return the bikes to that same station at which they started.

C) 'f_to_m_ratio' orders the stations by the female-to-male ratio of total ride time for rides that began at that station.
