# hubway

SQL queries I wrote on the Hubway Bicycle database (https://www.kaggle.com/harunshimanto/hubway-bicycles-in-boston).

One script orders the bike stations by the rate at which users return the bikes to that same station at which they started.

The other script orders the stations by the female-to-male ratio of the users who started there.
